**Instructions**: For this graph challenge, use the `florida.csv` and `florida_map.csv` datasets to create four data visualizations.

For the first, create a map with county-level detail of the state of Florida that shows the count of votes in favor of Pat Buchanan in 2000 (the variable `lib_00`), and that highlights Palm Beach County using a thick black line for its boundary.

For the second data viz, create a scatter plot that shows the vote count for Ross Perot in 1996 (`lib_96`) on the x-axis and the vote count for Pat Buchanan in 2000 (`lib_00`) on the y-axis. Layer over the scatter plot a linear regression line of best fit. Use the `gghighlight()` function from the `{gghighlight}` package to highlight the data point for Palm Beach.

For the third and fourth data visualizations, repeat 1 and 2 but use the variable `plib_00` for the map and `plib_96` and `plib_00` for the scatter plot.

Once you've made these figures, provide a short written response to the following questions: (1) ***Why does looking at the total count of the Libertarian vote alter our conclusions about whether Palm Beach is an outlier in the 2000 US Presidential election as compared to looking at the Libertarian Party's share of the total vote;*** and (2) ***which way of presenting the data provides a more accurate picture of Palm Beach relative to other counties?***
