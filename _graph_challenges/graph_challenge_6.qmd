For this graph challenge, apply a custom palette set with `set_palette()` from `{coolorrr}` in a data visualization. The specifics are up to you, but the graph must show something related to conflict, either over time, or how it's correlated with some other factor in a dataset that you've constructed using `{peacesciencer}`. If you get stuck, instead of coming up with something new, you can take code from a previous graph challenge submission and update it with a custom palette.

```{r}
## your code here
