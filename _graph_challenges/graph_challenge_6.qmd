For this graph challenge, I want you to produce four data visualizations that showcase one of the four types of color palettes we discussed in class:

1. Qualitative - maps colors to a discrete unordered set of categories.
2. Sequential - maps colors to either an ordered discrete category or numerical variable.
3. Diverging - maps colors to either an ordered discrete category or numerical variable that is centered around a reference category or value.
4. Binary - maps colors to a binary discrete category.

It is up to you what your data visualizations will be, but they must be relevant to international conflict. You should use the `{coolorrr}` package functions to update your color palettes.
