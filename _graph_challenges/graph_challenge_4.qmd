If you run the below code, it will read in a dataset with state-level returns from the 2020 and 2024 US presidential election and save it as an object called `dt`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dt <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milesdwilliams15/dpr-101-project-files/refs/heads/main/_data/state_data_2024.csv"
)
```

Combine this dataset with another produced using the "usmap" package, and create a map of the US that shows the state-level shift to or away from the Republican Party in 2024 relative to 2020 (rep_shift). Once you produce the data visualization, provide a short and clear summary of what the data says.
