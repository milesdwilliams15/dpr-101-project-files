Use the WTHH data to show the average of racial animus (`racial_resentment_scaled`) by partisan lean (`pid7`). Your estimate of the average of racial animus should be weighted using the WTHH survey weights (`weight_DFP`). Use examples from the lecture notes as a guide for how you might show the data.
