Graph challenges are worth 5% each of your final grade. I will grade each according to the following criteria. Each criterion is evaluated simply on whether you met the expectation, and they all carry equal weight.

1.  Were you able to get your code to run and render to a word (.docx) file? (yes/no)
2.  Did you produce a data visualization? (yes/no)
3.  Did you produce the kind of data visualization I asked for, or one that was appropriate given the type of data I gave you? (yes/no)
4.  Does the data visualization have chart junk? (yes/no) **\[A "no" for this one is a good thing\]**
5.  Did you use the "assertion-evidence" approach for your plot title? (yes/no)
6.  Did you include appropriate and clear labels for the axes and legends? (yes/no)
7.  If necessary, did you modify or augment the data in sensible ways prior to making your visualization? (yes/no)
8.  Did you offer a summary, interpreting what the data visualization shows? (yes/no)
9.  Is your summary clearly written? (yes/no)
10. Does your summary demonstrate that you understand what's going on in your data â€“ e.g., correct understanding of variables, what they measure, and how they're related? (yes/no)

Your grade is based on your score out of 10: 10/10 = 100% A+; 9/10 = 90% A-; etc...
