**Instructions**: Read in the dataset located at this url:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milesdwilliams15/dpr-101-project-files/refs/heads/main/_data/florida.csv

The data provides county-level detail for the state of Florida on candidate vote totals and vote shares in the 1996 and 2000 U.S. presidential elections. Totals are just a count of the total ballots cast for a candidate in a county. Shares are a candidate's count divided by all votes cast for president in a given county. There also are two columns, one called `count_residual` and another called `prop_residual`, that indicate the absolute prediction error from a linear model of Pat Buchanan's vote total and vote share, respectively, in 2000 based on Ross Perot's vote total or share in 1996. Essentially, bigger values in these columns mean that Buchanan's election performance was more unusual given how well Ross Perot did in 1996.

Use this data to create a county-level map of Florida showing the absolute error in Buchanan's vote total, and another map showing the absolute error in Buchanan's vote share. Palm Beach County should stand out as the biggest outlier when looking at vote totals, but does it still stand out when looking at vote shares? If not, which county does? After you make your maps, answer these questions and, if the biggest outlier is different, speculate about why this might be the case in a short summary.
