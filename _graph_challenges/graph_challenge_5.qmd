For this graph challenge your mission is to see if you can replicate the data visualization that I posted on this assignment's prompt in Canvas. Below I've given you the code you need to read in the data, but that's all. This dataset comes directly from the Correlates of War Project, and it provides country level detail on different participants in all-out wars over time. There are 95 wars in total in the dataset.

I'll also give you a hint. To add the war labels with lines connecting them I used the `{ggrepel}` package. You can install it by writing `install.packages("ggrepel")` in the R console. Good luck!

```{r}
## read in the data
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milesdwilliams15/Teaching/refs/heads/main/DPR%20101/Data/Inter-StateWarData_v4.0.csv"
wars <- read_csv(url)
```
