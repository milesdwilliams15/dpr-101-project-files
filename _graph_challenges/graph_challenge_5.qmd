The long peace theory generally holds that conflict is less likely now than in the past, but it argues this is true especially for major powers. Create a plot that shows the rate of conflict initiation over time among non-major powers versus major powers to see if this is the case. Use `{peacesciencer}` to create a state-year dataset and then populate it with the variables you need using `add_cow_majors()` and `add_mid_opportunity()` (remember that this is a custom function I made, so check the lecture notes to see how to use it). Use `{geomtextpath}` in some way to help compare trends in a single graph.
