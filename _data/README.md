## The _data folder

This folder contains most of the datasets we will use in DPR 101.

For those curious about how some of these datasets were wrangled and made presentable for y'all to use in class, you can check out the R script file called `_code_to_make_data.R` which provides all the code that I ran to make many of the datasets in this folder.
