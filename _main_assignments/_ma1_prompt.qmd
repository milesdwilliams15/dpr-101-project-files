Election fraud is a contentious issue in U.S. politics at the moment, and data literacy is key to navigating the claims being made. Can you use data to cut through the noise and show whether fraud played a role in the 2024 election? 

For your first main assignment, you'll answer this question by using a dataset that has county-level election returns compiled by the MIT Election Lab from the 2020 and 2024 U.S. presidential elections. It also contains measures produced by the conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, of instances of confirmed election fraud and measures of state-level election integrity. Your mission is to probe the data to see if there's evidence that states with higher historical frequency of fraud and worse election integrity show unusual county-level deviations in election returns between 2020 and 2024. *I'm not looking for an answer one way or the other. You look at the data and tell me what you think.*

To complete this assignment, you'll work in teams, to which I'll assign you randomly on Canvas. Together, you'll produce a series of data visualizations and write up your findings. I have uploaded to Canvas a Quarto template for you to use, but if it is more convenient to collaborate with a Google Document that is fine too. 

I except just on submission per team in the form of a polished word document. You have some freedom in how you'll proceed, but below I have some requirements for how you should structure your submission. You must adhere to the following outline, which will also serve as my grading rubric. Each point will be given equal weight. All members of a team will receive the same final grade.

## Preamble 

- Include a title for your submission.

- Include your team member names.

## Introduction 

- Include a section header.

- Should be one paragraph.

- Use clear and plain writing with no more than two typos or grammatical errors.

- Clearly state your research question (must end with a question mark).

- Explain why the question matters (context, relevance, importance).

## Data and Design 

- Include a section header.

- Two paragraphs.

- Use clear and plain writing with no more than two typos or grammatical errors.

- Do not use bullet points or numbered lists.

- Paragraph 1 – Describe the Data:

  * State the unit of analysis (e.g., “We use a county-level dataset”).

  * Provide a brief summary of key variables (e.g., vote totals, fraud counts, integrity scores).
 
  * Do not refer to variables using the raw column names in the dataset. 

  * Mention the sources of each variable (e.g., “Election data from MIT Election Lab; Heritage Foundation for fraud/integrity data”).

- Paragraph 2 – Describe Your Design/Approach:

  * Explain how you plan to use or visualize the data (e.g., compare vote changes to integrity scores, or deviations in vote share vs. fraud frequency).
 
  * Do not refer to specific R functions or packages as you describe how you'll visualize the data. You can say "First, we'll map out the distribution of Republican vote shares in the 2024 election." Don't say, "First, we'll use ggplot() and geom_sf() to create a map of Republican vote shares."

# Analysis 

- Include a section header.

- Four paragraphs.

- Use clear and plain writing with no more than two typos or grammatical errors.

- Do not use bullet points or numbered lists.

- Include four data visualizations in total (no more or less).

- At least one of the data visualizations must be a map of the U.S. showing the distribution of a variable of interest.

- At least one of the data visualizations must show the distribution of one variable of your choice using a histogram, density plot, or bar plot (e.g., fraud frequency, vote shift).

- At least one of the data visualizations must show the relationship between two variables using a scatter plot.

- All figures must have:

  * A figure number and title (e.g., “Figure 1: The title...”).

  * A title in the assertion–evidence format (title states the finding).

  * No sub-figure numbering (e.g., do not use “Figure 1a” / “1b”).
  
  * Clear labels, no chart junk, and no data errors.

- For each visualization write a paragraph that:
  
  * Comes *before* the data visualization.

  * Starts with a clear assertion about what the data shows.

  * Gives a brief summary describing how to "read" the visualization.
  
  * Explains how the data supports your assertion.
 
- No raw R output, tables, or statistical model results may appear anywhere in the text.

## Conclusion

- Include a section header.

- 1-2 paragraphs. 

- Use clear and plain writing with no more than two typos or grammatical errors.

- Summarize your findings.

- Go beyond summary and offer broader insights or claims about what your findings mean for understanding election integrity and fraud narratives. Feel free to pull from any of our readings.

## Citations

- If you reference something that isn't common knowledge, you should cite your source.

- Use in-text hyperlinks for citations rather than a traditional works cited style.

## Details about the data

I have included the dataset for you to download on Canvas. It's called "ma1_dataset.csv."

The data contains 3,151 rows. For each observation in the data, there are 19 columns with the corresponding names and definitions:

* `state_name`: The full state name.

* `county_name`: The full county name.

* `state_abbr`: The state abbreviation.

* `rep24`: The vote total for Donald Trump (the Republican presidential candidate) in 2024.

* `dem24`: The vote total for Kamala Harris (the Democratic presidential candidate) in 2024.

* `tot24`: The total number of votes cast for president in 2024.

* `rep20`: The vote total for Donald Trump (the Republican presidential candidate) in 2020.

* `dem20`: The vote total for Joe Biden (the Democratic presidential candidate) in 2020.

* `tot20`: The total number of votes cast for president in 2020.

* `rep_share24`: The vote share for Donald Trump (the Republican presidential candidate) in 2024.

* `dem_share24`: The vote share for Kamala Harris (the Democratic presidential candidate) in 2024.

* `rep_margin24`: The Republican vote share minus the Democratic vote share.

* `rep_share20`: The vote share for Donald Trump (the Republican presidential candidate) in 2020.

* `dem_share20`: The vote share for Joe Biden (the Democratic presidential candidate) in 2020.

* `rep_margin20`: The Republican vote share minus the Democratic vote share.

* `rep_shift`: The change in the Republican vote margin in 2024 relative to 2020.

* `fraud_cases`: The total number of documented fraud cases in a given state according to the Heritage Foundation.

* `integrity_score`: The election integrity score per state created by the Heritage Foundation. Scores can theoretically range from 0 to 100 where 100 is the best and 0 is the worst.

* `integrity_cat`: Contains 5 qualitative categories for election integrity, ranging from "1. Excellent" to "5. Terrible".
